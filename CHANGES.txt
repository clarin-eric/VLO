Production release 2.15 (August 2013)

Beta release 2.15 (July 2013)

Repaired the incorrect reference to profiles, and made
the connection to the solr server more tolerant. Files without
resources will be shown in the web application if and only if there is
a link to a landing page. 

Beta Release 2.14 (June 2013)

Support for theming was added, as were some new facet mappings, and the 
interface to the Federated Content Search was implemented in the form of 
a link - not as a search box like it was originally foreseen.

Beta release 2.13 (May 2013)

A new package, eu.clarin.cmdi.vlo.config was added taking care of the web 
application and importer's configuration. Spring is no longer used for 
configuration; it was replaced by the Simple framework.

Both the importer and the web application use the same base file for 
configuration. This file refers to external resources like for example
the nationalProjectsMapping.xml file. 

The base VloConfig.xml file that is included in the /src/main/resources 
directory of the package, can be replaced by an external instance. Additionally,
the web application's context file can be used to overrule the solrUrl parameter
defined in the packaged or external configuration file.

Added the nationalProjectsMapping file to the default configuration. This means
that it is no longer necessary to instance of the file external to the package. 
By the default the importer and web application will look at the packaged instance.

Landing page support on the result page was added; ticket 257.

Heap memory consumption of the importer was limited. A parameter was added to
to be able to tune the size of the buffer of documents waiting to be deposited 
in the database.

Repackaging was carried out. From version 2.13 the web application resides
outside the importer package. Next to these packages the solr package is still
there, and apart from the addition of a hidden facet supporting the landing 
page, it has not been modified. In a future release the VLO base functions will
be split off from the importer package.

Many small fixes.
Streamlined the deployment procedure.
