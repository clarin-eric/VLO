----------------------------
General upgrade instructions
----------------------------

If using a dockerised setup on basis of the VLO and Solr image available via 
<https://gitlab.com/CLARIN-ERIC>, the general upgrade instruction below do not apply.
Pleas do check the version specific instructions as they may be relevant.

If using the docker compose configuration (available via <https://gitlab.com/CLARIN-ERIC/
compose_vlo/>), make sure to remove the Solr home provisioning volume before bringing
the services up, as otherwise an obsolete Solr configuration may be applied to the Solr
container!!!

Below you will find a quick overview of the manual upgrade steps. For more details see 
DEPLOYMENT.md. Note that these steps do not apply in a direct way if you are using the
docker based setup. Be advised to always take note of the version specific upgrade
instructions (see below) in any case.

1. Unpack the VLO distribution tarball

2. Go to the 'war' directory.

3. Run the `unpack-wars.sh` script in that directory
  (OR execute the following steps manually:
	- Unzip the vlo-web-app-#.##.war in a new 'vlo' directory
	- Recursively assign ownership of the entire unpacked distribution to the
	appropriate user, i.e. 'vlouser' on catalog.clarin.eu)

4. In the 'config' directory, inspect VloConfig.xml and the data roots 
configuration file that is included into this file by means of XInclude. It is
advised to perform a diff between the old and new versions of these files.
Depending on configuration preferences, you may want to copy settings from the
old configuration to the new one. 

See the version specific upgrade instructions below to see whether any specific changes
require your attention at this point!

5. Stop 
	1) the Tomcat (or at least the VLO web app), and 
	2) the Solr server.
	3) jmxtrans, if applicable

6. Replace the 'current' symlink with a link to location of the new VLO directory.

7. Make sure that the installed Solr server is of a version matching the requirements of
the current version of the VLO, and that its home directory is configured to be the 
Solr home directory provided by the VLO in 'solr/vlo-solr-home'.
IMPORTANT: If 'transplanting' a Solr data directory from another server, make sure that 
you are running at least the same version of Solr as the source at which the index was
created.

Upgrading Solr can be done, depending on your OS, using the Solr installation script
`install_solr_service.sh` with the -f option. The 'solr' directory inside the VLO 
deployment package contains a tarball with scripts and information for 
installing/upgrading a Solr instance that matches this version of the VLO. For details,
see the `README.md` file in the VLO's Solr distribution and the general `DEPLOYMENT.md`.

Also see 
<https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/7_2/taking-solr-to-production.html#taking-solr-to-production>.

8. If needed, flush the Solr index (by removing the content of the Solr data directory).
The upgrade instructions for specific versions of the VLO indicate whether such a flush is
required and you may want to check with the person responsible for the instance of the VLO
you are upgrading.

If 'transplanting' a Solr index from another server, you can put it in the right location,
replacing the existing Solr data. Check your Solr configuration for the SOLR_DATA setting
which configures the location of the Solr data directory.

9. Start
	1) the Solr server, and
	2) the Tomcat server
	3) jmxtrans, if applicable

10. If you want to run an import straight away (discuss this with the person responsible
for the upgraded VLO instance), go to the `bin` directory and run the importer using the
updated configuration file:
    `./vlo_solr_importer.sh -c ../config/VloConfig.xml`

-----------------------------
Upgrading from 4.5.0 to 4.5.1
-----------------------------
Maintenance release, no changes required. Changes in the corresponding Docker image
and Docker Compose project may apply. See the documentation of the respective documents.

-----------------------------
Upgrading from 4.4.x to 4.5.0
-----------------------------
The changes with consequences for configuration and deployment in this version are:

1. Introduction of an authentication requirement for communication with the Solr server
   by clients including the VLO importer, web app and utilities to generate sitemap 
   and statistics
2. Introduction of a mechanism to support Javascript snippet based integrations, e.g.
   for user satisfaction assessment
3. Several changes in VloConfig.xml

See the sections below for details for all of these.

## §1: Solr authentication

The bundled Solr configuration has been extended with a security configuration (see
`solr/vlo-solr-home/security.json` in the deployment package) which enables basic 
authentication for all HTTP access. This file contains hashed passwords for a number of
users with different roles. The VLO has to be configured with credentials for both a user
with only read access, and a user with read/write access. For this purpose, new settings
have been introduced to VloConfig.xml (see §3). The `config.properties` file of the
statistics generator, if used, also needs to be adapted accordingly.

The docker compose setup for the VLO provides shared environment variables for securing
and accessing the Solr instance. See its documentation at 
<https://gitlab.com/CLARIN-ERIC/compose_vlo/>. IMPORTANT: the Solr home provisioning 
volume must (and can safely) be removed before starting the services after upgrading!!

For some technical notes, see <https://github.com/clarin-eric/VLO/issues/126> and
the relevant Solr documentation section at 
<https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/7_3/basic-authentication-plugin.html>.

## §2: User satisfaction rating and adding other functionality through javascript snippets

A new context parameter

	eu.clarin.cmdi.vlo.snippets.bottom.file

is now available that allows for the configuration of a location to load HTML content
to include below the closing 'body' tag. The concrete use case for this is to enable
integrations such as feedback collection via Mopinion.

The docker compose setup for the VLO contains a overlay (mopinion.yml) that enables
a feedback panel defined via <https://app.mopinion.com>. See the documentation at
<https://gitlab.com/CLARIN-ERIC/compose_vlo/>.

## §3: Changes in VloConfig.xml

VloConfig.xml has seen a change in the available configuration options, with both 
removals and new additions in this release

- Settings added to VloConfig.xml: 
	solrUserReadOnly, solrUserReadOnlyPass, solrUserReadWrite, solrUserReadWritePass
- Settings removed from VloConfig.xml:
	simpleSearchFacetFields, languageFilters, facetOverviewLength
- The nature of the following settings has changed in that the included fields should now
be referenced by key rather than field name:
	facetFields, primaryFacetFields, searchResultFields, ignoredFields, technicalFields

The bundled VloConfig.xml has all these changes applied. When upgrading, it is advised
to use the bundled VloConfig.xml and adapt as needed. When using the docker setup, all
important settings can be tweaked through environment variables. See its documentation at 
<https://gitlab.com/CLARIN-ERIC/compose_vlo/>.

-----------------------------
Upgrading from 4.4.2 to 4.4.3
-----------------------------
Maintenance release, no changes required (steps 4, 7 and 8 can be skipped)

-----------------------------
Upgrading from 4.4.1 to 4.4.2
-----------------------------
Maintenance release, no changes required (steps 4, 7 and 8 can be skipped)

-----------------------------
Upgrading from 4.4.0 to 4.4.1
-----------------------------
Maintenance release, no changes required (steps 4, 7 and 8 can be skipped)

-----------------------------
Upgrading from 4.3.x to 4.4.0
-----------------------------
The Solr schema has changed. Flush the index and run an import OR replace with a 
pre-imported index ('transplantation') - ask the developer what approach to take.

Make sure that the new Solr home content is applied to your Solr instance!!! Extra care 
has to be taken if using compose_vlo, please read its documentation at 
<https://gitlab.com/CLARIN-ERIC/compose_vlo/>.

You may optionally upgrade (at step 7) the Solr server to version 7.2.1 if your deployment
target has an older version installed. Note that this version of the VLO has NOT been
tested to work with Solr 7.3 or higher. 

IMPORTANT: Make sure that all configurations specific to the environment are kept while 
upgrading (i.e. make sure your solr.in.sh file is not altered in any problematic way - see
<https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/7_2/taking-solr-to-production.html>).

If applicable, make sure to also restart jmxtrans after restarting Solr for whatever
reason.

## Configuration

Three new properties have been added to VloConfig.xml:

- `valueMappingsFile`
  - This should be the (file:) URL of a value mapping definition, as can be found in 
  the VLO-mapping project <https://github.com/clarin-eric/VLO-mapping>. The file may use
  XInclude to combine multiple mappings, as is the case with the `master.xml` file found
  in VLO-mapping. Consult the VLO developers for information on the right file to use.
- `fields`
  - This contains a set of `field` properties, which map a set of pre-defined
  field keys to the names of actual fields defined in Solr. You can assume that the
  provided mapping matches the Solr schema distributed along with the VLO.
- `deprecatedFields`
  - Analogues to `fields` (see above), this contains the Solr field names of deprecated
  fields.
  
The following properties have been REMOVED:
- `useCrossMapping`
- `crossFacetMapUrl`
- `nationalProjectMapping`
  
## Docker

Two new environment variables have been added to the `docker-vlo` project, with defaults
suitable for most deployments including beta and production.  The appropriate settings 
will be guaranteed for those environments that have dedicated Docker Compose
configurations in the `compose_vlo` project.

- The new environment variable `VLO_DOCKER_VALUE_MAPPING_URI`
image. It sets the value for `valueMappingsFile` in `VloConfig.xml` (see above). The
default value `file:/srv/VLO-mapping/value-maps/dist/master.xml` works nicely with the
`compose_vlo` configurations.
- The new environment variable `VLO_DOCKER_WICKET_CONFIGURATION` can be used to select
the 'configuration mode' of Wicket, which is either 'deployment' (default) or 
'development' or. The default should be used in most cases, including beta and production
environments.

-----------------------------
Upgrading from 4.3.5 to 4.3.6
-----------------------------
Maintenance release, no actions required (Solr index can be kept).

Only the importer is affected by the changes in this release, so you could also choose
to only replace the importer (bin directory). No configuration changes are required.

-----------------------------
Upgrading from 4.3.4 to 4.3.5
-----------------------------
Maintenance release, no actions required (Solr index can be kept).

-----------------------------
Upgrading from 4.3.3 to 4.3.4
-----------------------------
Maintenance release, no actions required (Solr index can be kept).

-----------------------------
Upgrading from 4.3.2 to 4.3.3
-----------------------------
Maintenance release, no actions required (Solr index can be kept). Make sure that the
new Solr home content is applied to your Solr instance!!! Extra care has to be taken if
using compose_vlo, please read its documentation at <https://gitlab.com/CLARIN-ERIC/
compose_vlo/>.

-----------------------------
Upgrading from 4.3.1 to 4.3.2
-----------------------------
Maintenance release, no actions required (Solr index can be kept). Make sure that the
new Solr home content is applied to your Solr instance!!! Extra care has to be taken if
using compose_vlo, please read its documentation at <https://gitlab.com/CLARIN-ERIC/
compose_vlo/>.

-----------------------------
Upgrading from 4.3.0 to 4.3.1
-----------------------------
Maintenance release, no actions required (Solr index can be kept).

-----------------------------
Upgrading from 4.2.x to 4.3.0
-----------------------------

The version of Solr used by the VLO (i.e. the client version used in the front end and
importer and the server version it has been tested against) has been upgraded to 7.1. As
of version 6.0, Solr has been designed to run as a stand-alone service rather than be
deployed in a servlet container. Therefore when deploying VLO 4.3.0 or later, you must
ensure that an instance of Solr is available and correctly configured; it no longer comes
bundled with the VLO as a servlet. Follow the steps below to upgrade an existing VLO 4.2.x
deployment to VLO 4.3.0. You may also find it helpful to read the updated deployment
instructions (see DEPLOY.md).

- Install and configure a detached Solr instance

  - Use the OS's package manager if it provides a package for Solr 7.1.x
    - OR unpack the tarball 'solr/vlo-*-solr.tar.gz' and run the 'build-solr.sh' script
    in the resulting 'solr' directory, and then run the installer script:
    
      `target/solr/bin/install_solr_service.sh target/solr-7.1.0.tgz`
    
    Instructions, including options that allow you to deviate from the default settings
    (e.g. port to bind to) can be found in the official Solr documentation:
    
      https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/7_0/taking-solr-to-production.html#taking-solr-to-production
    
  - After installation, stop the Solr server and configure it to use the 
  'solr/vlo-solr-home' directory of the currently deployed version of the VLO as the 
  'solr.solr.home' directory, for example by adding/modifying the 'SOLR_HOME' variable in
  '/etc/default/solr.in.sh'.

  - Also configure an external Solr data directory by setting the 'solr.data.home'
  directory, for example by adding/modifying the 'SOLR_DATA_HOME' variable in 
  '/etc/default/solr.in.sh'.
    - When reusing an existing Solr data directory, make sure to clear it before starting
    Solr again, or populate it with an pre-calculated index (e.g. from another server).

- Configure the web application to connect to the new Solr instance. By default the Solr
server will bind to port 8983. The 'core' holding the VLO index is called 'vlo-index',
which assuming the defaults makes the Solr base URL 
'http://localhost:8983/solr/vlo-index/'. You can test this by retrieving the URL 
'base URL + select', e.g. 'http://localhost:8983/solr/vlo-index/select'.

  - Verify that the correct URL is configured in the VloConfig.xml configuration file
  in the VLO's 'config' directory.
  
  - If you are using the context parameter 'eu.carlin.cmdi.vlo.solr.serverUrl', update its
  value or remove it to make the web application use the value configured in the
  VloConfig.xml configuration file.
  
## Docker  

If you are building a Docker image, take note that 'docker' profile (previously 'beta') 
has a few additional VloConfig placeholders that need to be filtered before running the
front end or importer: 
- 'VLO_DOCKER_DELETE_ALL_FIRST', 
- 'VLO_DOCKER_MAX_DAYS_IN_SOLR'
- 'VLO_DOCKER_DATAROOTS_FILE'

While previous versions of the VLO made it easy to combine the VLO front end and the Solr
sever into one image (both deployed in one Tomcat instance), it now makes more sense to
use separate containers for the web app (optionally combined with the importer) and Solr.
For the latter, you can use the official off-the-shelve Solr image (see 
<https://hub.docker.com/_/solr/>) and set it up to use the configuration provided via
the VLO (e.g. set the Solr home directory to 'vlo-solr-home', via a mount), or CLARIN's
Solr image derived from the official image tuned to work within the CLARIN infrastructure
(see <https://gitlab.com/CLARIN-ERIC>). 

For an example that should be easy to make running in any environment, see the 
'compose_vlo' project (via <https://gitlab.com/CLARIN-ERIC>).

-----------------------------
Upgrading from 4.2.0 to 4.2.1
-----------------------------
* Two new configuration settings have been added related to parallel processing:
- fileProcessingThreads
- solrThreads

These need to be tweaked depending on the environment in order to get the best processing
while keeping the load accessible. The parameter `fileProcessingThreads` can be set to
`-1` to instruct the importer to initialise a "work-stealing thread pool" with a
parallelism level automatically determined by the JVM based on the number of available
cores. This is often a good choice.

For the 'beta' build profile, there are two new placeholders corresponding to the above
parameters. See <https://gitlab.com/CLARIN-ERIC/docker-vlo-beta/merge_requests/4> for
details. Note that this does not apply to other build profiles (including production)!

-----------------------------
Upgrading from 4.1.x to 4.2.0
-----------------------------

* There are several new configuration parameters in VloConfig.xml:

- licenseTypeMapUrl
- vcrMaximumItemsCount
- vcrSubmitEndpoint

Also notice that a new entry has been added to the 'ignoreFields' list in the same file.

The values set in the bundled VloConfig.xml files should be suitable for production and
testing environments.

* This release requires VLO-mapping version 1.1.0 or higher. Make sure to source that
you are sourcing the mapping definitions from an up-to-date location (see VloConfig.xml)
before running an import or starting the web application. See <https://github.com/clarin-eric/VLO-mapping>.

* The Solr schema has been updated for this release, so an existing index from a previous
version of the VLO can NOT be used. Make sure to create or use a fresh import started with
a clean index (for instruction, see above).

* For the 'beta' build profile, the bundled VloConfig.xml now contains placeholders for
several environment specific parameters. These need to be filtered before the application
processes the configuration. See <https://gitlab.com/CLARIN-ERIC/docker-vlo-beta/issues/1>
for details. Note that this does not apply to other build profiles (including production)!

-----------------------------
Upgrading from 4.0.x to 4.1.0
-----------------------------

* The facet-concept mapping file and uniformed mapping/normalisation files can now be
sourced from an external location (remote URL or local file system). This is the 
recommended way of setting up the VLO in any deployed environment. The required VLO mapping
definitions can be obtained from <https://github.com/clarin-eric/VLO-mapping> by cloning
the repository or downloading and unpacking the sources or distribution. Choose a fork
and/or branch that matches your environment (dev, beta, production...) and needs.

The VloConfig.xml defines the locations of these mapping files. Note that the bundled 
VloConfig.xml may already be preconfigured for your specific environment.

First, there is the 'facetConceptsFile'. The recommended way to configure it is using a
local file URL, for example:
	<facetConceptsFile>file:/srv/VLO-mapping/mapping/facetConcepts.xml</facetConceptsFile>
	
You can also use a remote location, e.g.:
	<facetConceptsFile>https://vlo.clarin.eu/mapping/facetConcepts.xml</facetConceptsFile>
...or also leave the property empty to use the bundled default definitions.

Then there is a set of properties nationalProjectMapping, organisationNamesUrl,
languageNameVariantsUrl, licenseAvailabilityMapUrl, resourceClassMapUrl, licenseURIMapUrl.
These too are ideally configured through a URL to a local file, for example:
    <nationalProjectMapping>file:/srv/VLO-mapping/uniform-maps/nationalProjectsMapping.xml</nationalProjectMapping>
    <organisationNamesUrl>file:/srv/VLO-mapping/uniform-maps/OrganisationControlledVocabulary.xml</organisationNamesUrl>
	....
	
To use bundled default mapping files, use relative paths such as
    <nationalProjectMapping>uniform-maps/nationalProjectsMapping.xml</nationalProjectMapping>
    <organisationNamesUrl>uniform-maps/OrganisationControlledVocabulary.xml</organisationNamesUrl>
	...
	
Both the web application and the importer make use of the files configured at these 
locations, so make sure that the content is available when starting the front end
or importer!

-----------------------------
Upgrading from 3.4.x to 4.0.0
-----------------------------

This version of the VLO is based on CMDI 1.2, and no longer processes
CMDI 1.1. Therefore make sure that all metadata presented to the importer
is CMDI 1.2.

There are two additions to the VloConfig.xml file:
    - "primaryFacetFields" has a number "primaryFacetField" values that define
    which fields are shown at first in the front end.
    - "lrSwitchboardBaseUrl" defines the base URL of the Language Resource
    Switchboard, which is used to create a link in the resources section of the
    record page.

Normally the default values can be adopted for both of these.

There are no changes in the Solr schema, so the existing index can be kept.

Versions 4.0.1 and 4.0.2 are maintenance releases that do not require any changes in
the environment or configuration as long as the packaged mapping definitions are used.

-----------------------------
Upgrading from 3.4.0 to 3.4.1
-----------------------------

Maintenance release without the need to changes the configuration. However,
optionally the newly added statistics reporter can be configured for use. To
do so, follow these steps:
    - Copy the configuration.properties file to a stable location and edit the
    values to match the current environment. Currently, the reporter allows for
    reporting by means of an XML report file and/or by sending data to a 
    (remote) statsd server. This behaviour can be toggled by means of the 
    configuration properties.
    - Schedule the following command to be run after the importer completes:

        ${VLO_DIR}/bin/statistics/start.sh ${SITEMAP_CONFIG_PROPS_FILE}

(See the README file in bin/statistics for more information)

-----------------------------
Upgrading from 3.3.x to 3.4.x
-----------------------------

* A set of 'availability' values needs to be configured in VloConfig.xml. This
determines which values are shown for the availability facet in the web app,
and also allows for the setting of a description and display value. An example
configuration is given in the following snippet:

    <availability>
        <availabilityValue value="PUB">
            <displayValue>Public</displayValue>
            <description>Publicly available resources</description>
        </availabilityValue>
    </availability>

The default VloConfig.xml file is pre-configured for use in production and
generally does not need to be altered.

* The Piwik tracker is now configurable via context parameters. Set the 
following parameters according to your preferences:

    <Parameter 
        name="eu.clarin.cmdi.vlo.piwik.enableTracker" 
        description="'true' or 'false', defaults to 'false'"
        value="true"/>

    <!-- Further piwik parameters can be skipped if enableTracker is false -->

    <Parameter 
        name="eu.clarin.cmdi.vlo.piwik.siteId" 
        description="defaults to '3'"
        value="3"/> <!-- '1' for testing/beta, '3' for production -->
    
    <Parameter 
        name="eu.clarin.cmdi.vlo.piwik.host" 
        description="defaults to 'https://stats.clarin.eu/'"
        value="https://stats.clarin.eu/"/>
    
    <Parameter 
        name="eu.clarin.cmdi.vlo.piwik.domains" 
        description="defaults to '*.vlo.clarin.eu'"
        value="*.vlo.clarin.eu"/> <!-- should match public hostname -->

See <https://stats.clarin.eu> for configuration details per environment.

* Notice that the VLO importer script has an heap space maximum size that has
been increased to 4 Gb (see bin/vlo_solr_importer.sh). This can be configured
by means of the newly added "VMOPTS" variable in the script file.

* There have been changes to the Solr configuration, so make sure to run or use
a fresh import started with a clean index.

* _Optionally_ configure the VLO sitemap generator, which can be found in 
bin/sitemap-generator:
    - Prepare a target directory for the sitemap file(s)
    - Copy the configuration.properties file to a stable location and edit the
    values to match the current environment
    - Schedule the following command to be run after the importer completes:

        ${VLO_DIR}/bin/sitemap-generator/start.sh ${SITEMAP_CONFIG_PROPS_FILE}

    - Configure your web server to serve the contents of this directory via a 
    stable public URL
    - Register the sitemap URL with Google and/or other search engines
(See the README file in bin/sitemap-generator for more information)

--------------------------
Upgrading from 3.2 to 3.3
--------------------------
* Take note of the change in VloConfig.xml which moves the data roots definition
out of VloConfig.xml by means of XInclude. The configuration file now gets
prepared for deployment environments at build time, so it is no longer necessary
to copy over old configuration values in all cases.

* Decide whether hierarchies should be indexed and displayed, and set the new
'processHierarchies' configuration element accordingly (true/false). This 
governs the behaviour of both the importer (will simply skip the 'update 
hierarchies' step if set to false) and the front end (will not display hierarchy
related UI components).

* In the context fragment for the VLO web application, ADD the following 
attribute to the <Context> root element:

   sessionCookiePath="/"

and, if set, REMOVE any "crossContext" parameter.
 
---------------------------
Upgrading from 3.1 to 3.2
---------------------------
* Take note of the following changes in VloConfig.xml:

- 'facetConceptsFile' now defines the location of the facet/concept mapping 
definition on disk; to use the default bundled definition, leave it empty. 
Before this used to have the value '/facetConcepts.xml' which will no longer be
valid - it can safely be replaced with either the empty string or 
'facetConcepts.xml' to use the file in the same directory as VloConfig.xml.

- 'languageLinkPrefix' element has been REPLACED by 'languageLinkTemplate';
remove the former and add the following to existing configurations:

	<languageLinkTemplate>https://infra.clarin.eu/content/language_info/data/{}.html</languageLinkTemplate>

- 'languageNameVariantsUrl' and 'licenseAvailabilityMapUrl' are now required
mapping configuration elements. So the following should normally be added:

    <languageNameVariantsUrl>/LanguageNameVariantsMap.xml</languageNameVariantsUrl>   
    <licenseAvailabilityMapUrl>/LicenseAvailabilityMap.xml</licenseAvailabilityMapUrl>

- optional 'showResultScores' element, defaults to false. Should be false except
when debugging result ranking.

- The facet field 'availability' is now available

* Be aware that the default maximum heap space of the importer has been
increased from 2GB to 3GB (by means of a change in bin/vlo_solr_importer.sh).

---------------------------
Upgrading from 3.0.x to 3.1
---------------------------

* (For stable version) Update the external service running at <http://infra.clarin.eu/
service/language/info.php> to select the 'languageCode' facet using ISO639-3 language 
codes, e.g. <http://catalog.clarin.eu/vlo/search?fq=languageCode:code:nep> for 'nep'. 
Contact Sander Maijers <sander@clarin.eu> for more information.

* Take note of the following changes in VloConfig.xml:
- 'imdiBrowserUrl' element has been removed
- 'organisationNamesUrl' element has been added (should normally have 
'/OrganisationControlledVocabulary.xml' as its value)
- the 'language' facet has been replaced with 'languageCode'; the latter replaces the
former in the 'facetField', 'simpleSearchFacetField' and 'searchResultField' elements

* Flush the solr index (remove the data directory) and run a new import or copy the
beta index over if it is based on a recent 3.1 import.

---------------------------
Upgrading from 3.0 to 3.0.1
---------------------------

No additional actions required, the existing Solr index can be kept

---------------------------
Upgrading from 2.18 to 3.0
---------------------------

* In version 3.0, the context parameters for the VLO web application have changed, see
the file META-INF/context.xml for examples. The following parameters are now being
processed:	

- eu.carlin.cmdi.vlo.config.location
	Optional but recommended. Should point to the location of VloConfig.xml that
	should be used. Replaces The previously available parameter 'externalConfig', which is
	no longer supported.

- eu.carlin.cmdi.vlo.solr.serverUrl
	Optional. Configures the base URL of the SOLR instance to connect to.
	Usage is not recommended, instead configure the Solr URL via VloConfig.xml (see 
	below).

* New options have been added to the shared VLO configuration file VloConfig.xml 
(in vlo-3.0/config):

- The 'length' attributes in list elements can be removed

- The Solr endpoint has changed because it is now multicore. Change for example:

	<solrUrl>http://localhost:8084/vlo_solr/</solrUrl>
    
into

	<solrUrl>http://localhost:8084/vlo_solr/core0/</solrUrl>

This also applies to the eu.carlin.cmdi.vlo.solr.serverUrl context parameter (see above).

- The following elements should be added:

	<!-- begin added in 3.0 -->

	<collectionFacet>collection</collectionFacet>

* The location of the Solr index data directory is now governed through a java system
property 'solr.data.dir'. Add the following to ${catalina.home}/bin/setenv.sh:

	export JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Dsolr.data.dir=/lat/webapps/vlo/solr/data-beta"

Substitute the directory with the actual desired location of the index data. The
parent directory has to exist and should be writable by the Tomcat user.

---------------------------
Upgrading from 2.17 to 2.18
---------------------------

* In version 2.18 of the VLO, the URL mapping has been changed. To prevent
existing references and bookmarks from breaking, add rewrite rules to the
HTTP server to achieve the following mappings:

[TODO: Define actual mod_rewrite rules and document here]

- {vlobase}/?wicket:bookmarkablePage=:eu.clarin.cmdi.vlo.pages.ShowResultPage&docId={docId}
	-> {vlobase}/record?docId={docId}

- {vlobase}/?wicket:bookmarkablePage=:eu.clarin.cmdi.vlo.pages.ShowAllFacetValuesPage&selectedFacet={facet}
	-> {vlobase}/values/{facet}

In both case all additional GET parameters SHOULD be kept.

Next to the URL mapping, the XML parameter file has undergone some changes:

    <!-- Sets the maximum number of page instances which will be stored in the application scoped second level cache for faster retrieval -->
    <pagesInApplicationCache>40</pagesInApplicationCache>
    
    <!-- Sets the maximum size (in KILOBYTES) of the File where page instances per session are stored. -->
    <sessionCacheSize>10000</sessionCacheSize>

Has been added to tune the Wicket page cache. The first parameter allows you
to set the size of the application wide cache holding pages. The second parameter
denotes the size of the cache (in kilobytes) associated with a session. The values
listed above are the Wicket defaults.

Other changes in the parameter file:
- maxFileSize and use MaxFileSize have been integrated into one parameter:
  
  maxFileSize

  If equal to 0, no upper limit to the size of metadata input files will be 
  applied.

- maxDaysToLife has been renamed into maxDaysInSolr

- VloHomeLink has been renamed into homeUrl

- helpUrl has been added; a link to a help page.

- The facetConceptsFile parameter, referencing the facetConcepts.xml file, 
  has been added also. This is part of the effort of making parameterised 
  instantiation of the VLO possible.

- Also, the facetOverviewLength parameter has been added. This parameter controls
  the listing of facets on the search page.

- Similar to 'useMaxFileSize' the expectReverseProxy parameter has been removed

Finally, 

    <cqlEndpointFilter>http://cqlservlet.mpi.nl/</cqlEndpointFilter>
    
    <cqlEndpointAlternative>http://cqlservlet.mpi.nl/</cqlEndpointAlternative>

add the possibility of creating a filter for endpoints.
