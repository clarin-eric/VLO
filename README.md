# What is the VLO?

Using the VLO faceted browser, you can browse metadata by facet. It consists of three
software components: a Solr server with VLO specific configuration, an importer and a
web application front end.

For more information, see the [wiki page](https://trac.clarin.eu/wiki/CmdiVirtualLanguageObservatory).

# Building

Build the project using Maven in the project root, or use the [build.sh](./build.sh)
script, which will use a docker image with the correct version of Java and Maven to build.
See the script source for more details.


# Running the VLO 

After a successful [deployment](DEPLOYMENT.md) and configuration, you should be able to
browse to the VLO web app and browse the imported records. You can also run the VLO
locally using the docker image (see [compose_vlo](https://gitlab.com/CLARIN-ERIC/compose_vlo))

If the VLO is empty, you will need to run an import first. 

## Running an import 

To run an import, go the `bin` child directory of the VLO application directory 
and run

`./vlo_solr_importer.sh`
	
as the appropriate user (e.g. `vlouser`). 

It's advisable to run this in a detached background process (for example using 
`screen`) because an import can take quite a long time depending on the amount
of records to be imported. Also make sure that enough memory is available. 
Some VM parameters are configured inside the script.

Some progress information is logged to a file `log/vlo-importer.log`. It gets
rotated automatically by the import process.

For a __fresh import__, even when the VLO is not configured to delete all documents
from the index first, you can simply remove the contents of the Solr data 
directory (check server configuration documentation for the exact location).
